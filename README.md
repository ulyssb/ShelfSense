## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image** — The frontend sends your bookshelf photo to the backend.
2. **AI Vision Analysis** — The backend uses AI's vision capabilities to identify visible book titles.
3. **Personalized Suggestions** — The app recommends 5–7 new books based on your bookshelf and genre preferences.
4. **Real Covers & Metadata** — Open Library data enriches the results with actual book covers and descriptions.
